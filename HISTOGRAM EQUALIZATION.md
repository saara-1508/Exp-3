A digital image is a two-dimensional matrix of two spatial coordinates, with each cell specifying the intensity level of the image at that point. So, we have an N x N matrix with integer values ranging from a minimum intensity level of 0 to a maximum level of L-1, where L denotes the number of intensity levels. Hence, the intensity levels of a pixel r can take on values from 0,1,2,3,â€¦. (L-1). Generally, L = 2m, where m is the number of bits required to represent the intensity levels. Zero level intensity denotes complete black or dark, whereas L-1 level indicates complete white or absence of grayscale.
